In this lab we began to explore the idea of hardware and interrupts. For sensors like buttons, 
potentiometers, etc… the state/value of the sensor changes, but knowing when it does and 
incorporating it into code is different than just calling it. For information like that, information that 
needs to constantly be updated, we used and implemented interrupts.  One of the many parts to this lab 
was simply thinking of interrupts as a “refresh” button for sensors and other things that need to be 
updated regularly. In this lab we played more with hardware and the principles/basis behind it to 
implement pieces of it (like the lights and buttons) in useable c code.

For this lab I started out by looking at the individual pieces/parts. It was helpful to have a design plan 
provided for this one since the concept of hardware manipulation was fairly new. The lab manual was 
detailed and provided good info on what we were supposed to do, but the section on implementing 
leds.h was a bit difficult to understand and see what was supposed to be implemented. After writing the 
file it was easy to see what was asked, but when first starting out it was worded a bit confusingly.


In all I spent about 10 hours on this lab. I liked the lab overall as it showed us in small steps how to use 
and implement hardware. However, the buttons library was difficult to implement. The buttons always 
seemed to have some issue with them and it took a fair amount of tweaking to get it to work right. I 
think that this was a good lab to work on, and I liked implementing the built in oled. The points seem 
fairly distributed, and overall I think this is one of the better labs we’ve had so far.
