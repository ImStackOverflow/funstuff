This lab was difficult. The focus of this lab was the implementation of the i/o standard library for files. It 
showed how to use C in a way different from what we usually use it. Up until this point our use of C has
 been in terms of embedded systems with small processors. In this lab, we implemented C on a large, 
fully functional computer system (the unix cluster) where we had to connect and use external files.


The lab began with reading the lab manual. From there I read the header files to get a feel for what we 
were going to be writing in the libraries. I began coding by writing the source file for player.h. Next, I 
began to implement the Game.h source file. Everything went wrong. If I were to approach this lab 
differently I would have given it much more time to figure out the implementation of the file functions, 
as well as using the unix cluster.

I was unable to get the game to work in the end, and the implementation of the file i/o functions was 
incorrect. I spent approximately 8 hours on the lab, as I was unable to code more due to other finals this 
week. The lab seems a bit unnecessary when compared to the rest of the labs. The concepts it was 
meant to teach were interesting, and the lab itself seems fun. However, learning how to implement the 
lab on the unix cluster, about function pointers, and how to use the file i/o standard functions was too 
much to learn given the time frame. Using the unix cluster proved to be more difficult than first thought, 
as most of our work has been with embedded systems until this point, and I have little experience with 
unix and implementing programs through a command line interface. It’s easy to see how useful the 
concepts in this lab would be for programing large C programs, but with other finals going on the 
amount of material was too much to be finished.
