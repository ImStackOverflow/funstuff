Lab03 written by masterbyte coder Gavin Chen
Lab03 worked on by both Gavin Chen and Zeno Nanon

The lab consisted of two main parts: creating a library of functions for math using matrices and then 
ensuring they are functional functions by writing a concurrent testing harness. The main piece of the lab 
was creating the testing harness. The harness not only ensured the output of the function would be 
correct but also that the algorithm behind the function was sound. A large piece of the lab was also 
learning how to do math using matrices. A significant portion of the lab was spent reviewing some of 
the lesser known matrix operations such as multiplication, inverse, transposition, etc…
Carrying out the coding of the lab began with the functions, then with the harness. The lab manual was 
helpful in that it explained the math behind matrices and gave examples of how to perform the various 
operations. The first piece that went wrong was the testing harness. Most of the functions were fairly 
straight forward save the last few. The part I liked the most was using arrays and accessing each element
 by use of for loops. If I were to do it again I would have worked on more of it with my partner and split 
the load, instead of how we ended up doing it. The modular nature of the lab made collaboration much 
easier as well as testing much easier.

I am very satisfied with the lab. There were/still are some issues with the use of matrices, and the 
handling of arrays in c is more difficult than in some other programing languages. I spent approximately 
18 hours on the lab. the hardest part was writing the testing harness for the functions that refused to 
co-operate, as well as writing the functions for the inverse and determinant operations. The lab as a 
whole is defiantly very worthwhile, as working with both arrays and testing harnesses was both 
interesting and useful, especially with the use of imbedded functions, because it ensured that at the 
very least the functions were working as expected. The examples in the lab manual helped the most, 
and a large majority of the lab needed to be worked out on one’s own. The point system could be 
broken up better; with only 12 total points any small errors could have a large impact.
