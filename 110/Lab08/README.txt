In this lab we learned about the binary tree as a way for storing and accessing data, as well as recursive 
programing to generate the tree. Both of the concepts were very interesting, however challenging. The 
idea of recursive programing and binary trees was elegant in their simplicity. It was interesting seeing
 how the program was able to complete itself by calling itself. It was also interesting to learn how the 
tree was able to correctly parse in the data that it needed to.

The lab began with reading the lab manual. I looked it over to see what needed to be done, and then 
began on the tree.c file. I then moved onto the morse.c file and implemented the various other 
functions that took care of handling the binary tree. Creating the tree.c file took multiple tries. First was 
making the binary tree itself, and the next step was to pass in the data in a certain way so that it aligned 
with the tree. Writing the handler functions was a bit easier, as I had written tree.c and so had a good 
grasp on how the handler functions should work with the tree. If I were to do it again I would most likely 
have done it the same, by first working on the tree.c file and moving on.

In the end I spent approximately 15 hours on the lab. I wasn’t able to debug it as well as I wanted as my 
board seemed to malfunction and would not display the oled. However I was able to thoroughly debug 
the tree.c file and verify that it created the tree correctly with all the data in the correct spots. My 
favorite part of the lab was the concept of recursive programing. My least favorite part was the 
implementation of the buttons library. While it was nice having a wrapper function for the buttons 
library as opposed to implementing it as is in main, it was still difficult to use the buttons. For whatever 
reason, getting a consistent reading on the buttons is difficult and so coding it becomes a challenge. All 
in all the lab was well designed and showed very well the idea and concepts taught in class. If I were to 
change on piece it would be to distribute the points differently. The majority of points should be 
towards the tree.c code as I feel that was conceptually the most difficult and the largest part of the lab.
