In this lab we dove more into the idea of hardware and event handling. We dealt the idea of finite state
 machines, and we implemented an event driven programing type. Important aspects of this lab was the 
extensive use of hardware and interrupts, and the planning and developing of what the program is 
supposed to do before beginning coding.


The lab began with first reading the lab manual and getting a feel for what was asked of us. I then began 
with the coding of the oled screen, and made some functions that handled refreshing of the screen. 
Next was coding the FSM that handled decision making and controlled the “toaster oven”. The use of 
a switch case fitted perfectly with the FSM, and it was interesting learning how to apply what was taught 
in class. The most difficult piece of the lab was implementing the buttons. The buttons hardware never 
seemed to work correctly, and I was never able to get the board to register when a button was pressed. 


In total I spent approximately 20 hours on this lab. The most time was spent debugging, and the most 
challenging part of debugging was trying to work with the buttons library and trying to implement the 
buttons into the FSM. I tried several different ways of using the interrupts and the buttons function, but 
it never quite seemed to work in practice. The lab was fun and I learned a lot about event programming 
as well as interrupts. The point distribution seemed appropriately to me, and the lab in general was well 
designed. The only change I would make would be to replace the use of buttons with switches, as the 
switched seemed easier to implement and are less error prone than the buttons. The class discussions 
were  helpful and showed me how to do what needed to be done, as well as the principled behind how 
the concepts worked.
