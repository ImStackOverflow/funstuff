The lab was interesting and helped teach us how to implement stack type data storage. I think the most 
important aspect of the lab was learning what a stack is and how to implement it to process values in a 
clean, concise, and compact form. The lab manual presented things well, but there was too much of a 
problem with the string processing piece of the lab. The lab would have been more effective if it were 
solely teaching us about stacks, but having to implement the string processing functions was a challenge
in its own right and should have a lab dedicated to it. The processing and usage of the string functions 
was too much to finish in this lab, at least for me and in the way that I implemented it. 

My approach began with the lab manual. It was a good starting point, and along with the comments in 
the stack.h file we had a good overview of how to create the stack functions. Most of the errors were 
with logic and were easily squashed in the stack.c file, however I was not able to get past the 
implementation of the string processing functions. If I were to do it again I would have used different 
logic for the processing piece of the calculator. Working with another student in for this lab was helpful, 
but only to an extent. There was too much that we had to do ourselves and the benefit of working with 
a partner was very useful in working out the logic behind the code, but not very helpful in writing the 
code out.

The code half worked. The stack functions are coded and functional, but I never was able to figure out 
strtok, fgets, and the other string functions. The logic behind the string processing is sound to my 
knowledge, but the implementation of the various functions was too difficult to figure out. It was a very 
worthwhile lab in the way it teached the logic behind stacks, and I liked how scalable the idea of stacks 
are and how easy it is to implement. The hardest part was, again string processing, but mostly because it 
was something that is not easily learned alone/without someone to show in great detail how to 
implement the functions. The class helped with the lab a lot, but I had too many questions to be
 answered in lab or in class.
