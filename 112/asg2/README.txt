In this assignment I implimented dc in ocaml. I was able to finish 
all the functions provided and also the line split function and 
the registers. I ran the test input files and the calculations 
were correct. I also ran the mk.test script and no errors were
produced execept for discrepancies with 
the EOF output and some other minor differences with messages. 

This was kinda fun as far as homework goes. Way better than the 
f@!#$%$ scheme assignment. The language is better, or maybe just
the assignement was easier. Either way I didn't want to blow 
my brains out at then end of it and was actually able to submit 
a working program that passed the tests. 

I know no one will end up reading this except the grading script but 
Mackey please have more assignments like this one scheme is the worst 
thing I have ever known and the interpreter molested my brain to mush. 
Also keep quoting Djikstra some people seem to be tired of it 
but they're also CS losers with no sense of humor unless you 
translate the joke into ASCII binary and feed it to them on punch 
ccards (which I honestly would not be surprised if you knew how to do).

Keep on Ballin prof you're a great teacher.
