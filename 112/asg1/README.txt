I submitted the sbi.scm program to accomplish what the pa01 pdf wanted. It runs through the provided sbir and does what the lines tell it to do. I got print to work. Evaluate statements too. And input. Also all of the math functions. It was able to run:
00-hello-world
01-1to10
02-exprs
11-let
12-let
25-pi-e-fns


The hashbang is not letting me run on the server for whatever reason, saying permission is denied. I left the hashbang as is provided in the sbi.scm file. Ran checksource and fixed all the errors.
