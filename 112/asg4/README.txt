I was able to get the program to find a path and get the times, however I had issues adding the times to a list to be able to print out. The program is able to find all the flight paths given the input, but can only save a list of the nodes, not the times. I compute the times given the valid nodes. There is an error where my code prints out multiple itterations of the flight itenarary, but the itenerary itself is correct. I was able to implement airport test checking code to make sure the inputs are valid. I was also able to implement the haversign function and the print function.
