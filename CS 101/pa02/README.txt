This program builds off of pa01 and creates a matrix that gives a graphical visualization of the adjacency matrix. It parses an input file, creates the graph adt similar to pa01, and then creates a n x n matrix with 1 coresponding to a connection and a 0 coresponding to no connection. The program also transposes the input and prints it out, then transposes it again and prints it again. The twice transposed matrix/graph is exactly the same as the non-transposed version. To run it, simply call make to compile the binary file, then run it as ./graph02 <flags> <input file>. The makefile also includes a clean utility that will delete the binary file.
