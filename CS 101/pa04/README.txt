I have read and understood the Academic Misconduct Policy for
    Undergraduates, the related sections 102.01-102.016 and 105.15 of the
    UC Santa Cruz Student Policies and Regulations Handbook,
    and the related sections of the class syllabus.

To run the program first compile it using the makefile and the command make. It runs with the normal input arguments eg. ./greedy04 -<P/D> <start vertex> <input file>. Test2.in is the same as the graph provided in the Prims section in the book and shows the behaviour of prims algorithm. test1.in is the small sample input and shows the output format. Test3 tests djikstras algorithim, and test4 is a large input file to test scalability.
