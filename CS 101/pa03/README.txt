    Undergraduates, the related sections 102.01-102.016 and 105.15 of the
    UC Santa Cruz Student Policies and Regulations Handbook,
    and the related sections of the class syllabus.

This program builds off of pa01 and 02. It parses an input file, creates the graph adt similar to pa01. So far only my DFS works. To run it, simply call make to compile the binary file, then run it as ./graph02 <flags> <input file>. The makefile also includes a clean utility that will delete the binary file.
