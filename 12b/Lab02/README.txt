In this lab I (Gavin Chen) submitted FileCopy.java FileTokens.java FileReverse.java and a Makefile.
I got FileCopy.java and FileTokens.java to work (duh) and also wrote code that made FileReverse.java work
as specified. I also made a MakeFile that compiled FileReverse, created an output file called "out"
and created a jar file called FileReverse.jar. I also included a command that ran the jar file that
specified an input file "in" and output to "out". I didnt include the input file so it might throw an
error when make is called. Also added a command to compile FileCopy and FileTokens, and one last command 
to clean up all the files made from the make file.
